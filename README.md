# Two-Tables
Solution for "Combine Two Tables"

The code is an SQL query that combines information from the tables "Person" and "Address" to obtain people's names and addresses. By using a "LEFT JOIN" and the column "personId" as the joining criterion, the query retrieves the corresponding names and addresses of individuals, displaying "NULL" for addresses if there is no match in the "Address" table.
